This repository contains some reference applications for Graphics. This is
provided on an as-is-where-is basis without any support.

This repo contains standalone apps that show how to use certain Graphics
features. We have other repositories that contain system level applications
which are integrated with other IPs or SW frameworks.
http://git.ti.com/glsdk/example-applications
http://git.ti.com/glsdk/omapdrmtest

When the Graphics features are integrated into system level applications, the
corresponding standalone test applications in this repository are deleted.

In short, don't expect any maintenance or support for applications in this
repository. They can very well disappear someday.

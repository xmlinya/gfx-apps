Build steps
=================
1.Update the toolchain(cross-compiler toolchain path), and target NFS paths in rules.make as on your machine.

2.Issue make clean.

3.Issue make

4.Issue sudo make install if you want to directly install onto the NFS path that you gave in rules.make or you can copy the pixmapTriangle executable created in the current directory to required NFS path on target.

Execution steps
===============
1.Boot up the EVM.

2.Run pvrsrvinit.

3.Run attached sample app as ./pixmapTriangle

When you run the sample app as above & press ctrl-c, you will get the output pixmap-output-file-argb file generated in the same directory from where you ran the app.
This file contains the first 10 frames generated.
This can be viewed with any image viewer(For example 7yuv) that supports viewing raw RGB files.
Use the setting of 640x480 and 32 bpp while viewing the pixmap-output-file-argb file generated when using the above command (./pixmapTriangle).

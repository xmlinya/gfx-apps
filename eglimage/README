This is a simple example to show use of eglimage extension. This extension is
typically used for video streaming.

This example assumes you already have the GLSDK 6.04.00.02 installed on your
host system. There should also be a GLSDK target filesystem against which this
example builds.

Below are the build/execution instructions for this example -

Build steps 
=============
1. Edit the Makefile to set variables for GLSDK target filesystem path
2. Ensure that the Linaro cross compiler toolchain is part of your $PATH
3. make clean
4. make

Execution Steps
=================
1. Boot the Jacinto6 EVM
2. Run pvrsrvinit to initialize the graphics driver
3. Run this test application as ./eglimage_sample
